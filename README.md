# Operational Context Graph Repository Template

Default template for Operational Context Graph open source repositories managed by SAP. All repositories on github.com/operational-context-graph are created based on this template.

## To-Do

In case you are the maintainer of a new Operational Context Graph open source project, these are the steps to do with the template files:

- Install the [REUSE tool](https://reuse.readthedocs.io/) locally via pip (`pip install reuse`) to validate license compliance before pushing. The system package (e.g. via apt) is outdated and does not support `REUSE.toml`.
- Check if the default license (Apache 2.0) also applies to your project. A license change should only be required in exceptional cases. If this is the case, please change the [license file](LICENSE).
- Enter the correct metadata for the REUSE tool. You can find an initial .reuse/dep5 file to build on. Please replace the parts inside the single angle quotation marks < > by the specific information for your repository and be sure to run the REUSE tool to validate that the metadata is correct.
- Adjust the contribution guidelines (e.g. add coding style guidelines, pull request checklists, different license if needed etc.)
- Add information about your project to this README (name, description, requirements etc). Especially take care for the <your-project> placeholders - those ones need to be replaced with your project name. See the sections below the horizontal line and [our guidelines on our wiki page](https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/spaces/ospodocs/pages/3564976048/Guidelines+for+GitHub+Health+files+Readme+Contributing+Code+of+Conduct#GuidelinesforGitHubHealthfiles(Readme,Contributing,CodeofConduct)-Readme.md) what is required and recommended.
- Remove all content in this README above and including the horizontal line
